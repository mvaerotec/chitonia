Welcome to Chitonia's World
===========================

Chitonia is a game where you can control... Well not exactly. Chitonia is not just a game.
It is the very first interactive game ever where you can control a Gatete (sometimes)!!!! And a Chita!!!! And a Pomtito!!!!

The aim of the game is to survive through rounds sorting out the different inconveniences that may appear.
To play, just clone the repository and execute the `main.py` file.

As a tip, you need to pay special attention to the prompts, so that you don't miss any situation you need to act about.

Head over to `the documentation <https://chitonia.readthedocs.io>` to discover more. Enjoy!
